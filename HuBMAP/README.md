Competition description: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/hubmap-kidney-segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/c/hubmap-kidney-segmentation)

Original submission used YOLOV5 model with Pseudo Labeling method, which used OOF-evaluation to search the best `score_threshold` for final prediction.  
Discarded this kernel due to the competition policy restrict the use of YOLOV5, so I finally chose the effnet and other models, which is under MIT license, 
to be my final submissions. Private Score: 0.6667; Public Score: 0.7685 (not submitted)

Final submission kernel used efficientdet d5 with TTA (Test Time Augmentation) such as Flip, Rotate. Private Score: 0.6491; Public Score: 0.7352
