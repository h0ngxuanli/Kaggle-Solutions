- We integrated test set with pseudo-labels into train set. The pseudo-labels [submission_TF_1_034_10.csv](HuBMAP/model3/submission_TF_1_034_10.csv) / [submission.csv](HuBMAP/0.936gpu1-b3_lr_find_me20_bs12/submission.csv) were generated from [V2- HuBMAP: TF with Multi model ensumble[sub] [Version 10]](https://www.kaggle.com/code/durbin164/v2-hubmap-tf-with-multi-model-ensumble-sub) and [Kidney Unet model (keras) inference [Version 284] ](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vgarshin/kidney-unet-model-keras-inference) separately.

- We augmented image with RandomBrightnessContrast, HueSaturationValue and ContrastLimitedAHE to suppress the effect of blur, over-bright and over-dark regions in the image.

<div align = "justify">  
  
- During training, we randomly sampled tiles with a high probability of containing glomeruli based on PDF from TIFF tissue image to enable a robust model and fast training convergence. We adopted the U-net with EfficientNet as backbone to train on those tiles and the model was trained With Mixed Precision to double the batch size.

- Final submission kernel used an ensemble of two models with highest Public Score (0.936/0.935).  _Private Score: 0.9467; Public Score: 0.9394_
